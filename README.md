What My App Is About

BrewByte is a simple café ordering app.
Users can view the menu, add items to the cart, see their order history, and take a profile selfie.
The app also shows the location of the café on Google Maps.
It is designed to be easy to use and clean for everyday customers.

How My App Works

The user opens the app and sees the main menu with different food and drink items.
They can tap ADD to put items into the cart.
The bottom navigation lets the user move between Home, Orders, and Profile screens.
The profile page allows the user to take a selfie using the camera.
There is also a button that opens Google Maps to show the café location.
All screens are simple to use, and the app runs smoothly with no crashes.
